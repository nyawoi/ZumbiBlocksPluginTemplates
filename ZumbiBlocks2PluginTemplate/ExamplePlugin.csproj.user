            Custom Zumbi Blocks 2 install locations go here:
            Installed Steam on another drive? Have a depot download?
            Maybe you're using the itch.io version? If so, this property is for you!
            Set this property to your Zumbi Blocks 2 installation directory.

            Optionally, set an environment variable named ZumbiBlocks2_Location to your
            game's install location, and never have to worry about this property again!
